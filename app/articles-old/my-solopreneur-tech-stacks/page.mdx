## Tech Stacks
- Next JS 15, with app router 
- Zustand Store 
- Prisma ORM
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript
- Eslint
- Prettier

## Rules

### Zustand Rules:
- Create every Zustand Store in `src/store` folder
- If the store is called `userStore`, the corresponding `user-store.ts` file will be created in `src/store` folder
- the typescript interface of the store will be created in `src/types` folder. 
- the typescript interface parameters need to be the camel cased versions of the data stored in the postgres database (e.g. postgres database column name `user_id` needs to be written as `userId` in the typescript interface)


### React Components Rules:

- start writing page in `src/app/<page_name>/page.tsx`, as it is
- use zustand store in `src/app/<page_name>/page.tsx` by importing the store from `src/store/<store_name>.ts` if it has relation with the data on the database. 
- React's `useState` hook can be used for local state only. Rewrite to Zustand store if it will be used repeatedly in multiple pages / components. 
- for repeatable components, use the `useStore` hook to get the store from the context. Put the component in `src/components` folder
