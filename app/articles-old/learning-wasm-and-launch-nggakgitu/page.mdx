I've recently discovered how powerful WebAssembly (WASM) is and how it enables running complex computations directly in the browser. I was especially impressed when I learned that FFmpeg can run in the browser using WASM. Since I'm still new to WASM, I'm constantly learning new things about it. To put my knowledge into practice, I built a simple website that allows users to convert files, merge PDFs, and perform other tasks—all done privately in the browser without uploading anything to a server.
so I launched https://fastpdf.net.

Currently, I started the website with few simple tools and will add more tools in the future:

- PDF Merger (https://fastpdf.net/pdf-merger)
- PDF Splitter (https://fastpdf.net/pdf-split)
- Image Converter (https://fastpdf.net/image/file-conversion/jpeg-converter)
- Video Converter (https://fastpdf.net/video/file-conversion/mp4-converter)
- Audio Converter (https://fastpdf.net/audio/file-conversion/mp3-converter)

Anyone can use this website for free. And If you want to support me, you can suggest a feature or tools that you want to see in this website by filing a form in my website.
